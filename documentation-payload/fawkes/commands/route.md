## Summary

Display the system routing table with optional filtering. Essential for understanding network segmentation, identifying pivot opportunities, and mapping internal network topology during post-exploitation.

Cross-platform — works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| destination | No | — | Filter by destination IP or subnet (substring match) |
| gateway | No | — | Filter by gateway IP (substring match) |
| interface | No | — | Filter by network interface name (case-insensitive) |

## Usage

```
# Show all routes (default)
route

# Filter by destination
route -destination 192.168

# Filter by gateway
route -gateway 10.0.0.1

# Filter by interface
route -interface eth0

# Combine filters
route -destination 0.0.0.0 -interface eth0
```

### Browser Script

Output is rendered as a sortable table in the Mythic UI with columns: Destination, Gateway, Netmask, Interface, Metric, Flags. Default gateway entries are highlighted blue.

### Example Output (JSON)
```json
[
  {"destination":"0.0.0.0","gateway":"192.168.1.1","netmask":"0.0.0.0","interface":"eth0","metric":100,"flags":"UG"},
  {"destination":"192.168.1.0","gateway":"","netmask":"255.255.255.0","interface":"eth0","metric":100,"flags":"U"}
]
```

## Platform Details

### Windows
Uses `GetIpForwardTable` API from `iphlpapi.dll` for IPv4 routing table. Resolves interface index to friendly names (e.g., "Ethernet 2", "Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1"). Route types: direct (local subnet), indirect (via gateway).

### Linux
Parses `/proc/net/route` for IPv4 routes and `/proc/net/ipv6_route` for IPv6 routes. Decodes hex-encoded addresses. Flags: U=up, G=gateway, H=host, D=dynamic, M=modified.

### macOS
Parses output of `netstat -rn` for routing table entries. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.

## OPSEC Considerations

- Read-only enumeration — no modifications to the routing table
- Uses standard APIs and /proc filesystem — minimal footprint
- `netstat` subprocess on macOS may appear in process list briefly
