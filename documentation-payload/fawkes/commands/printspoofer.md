## Summary

PrintSpoofer privilege escalation — one-step SeImpersonate to SYSTEM via the Print Spooler service.

{{% notice info %}}Windows Only{{% /notice %}}

Implements the [PrintSpoofer technique](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) by creating a named pipe and triggering the Print Spooler service (running as SYSTEM) to connect to it. Once connected, the SYSTEM token is captured and stored for impersonation.

This is the preferred method for escalating from service accounts (NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE, IIS AppPool, MSSQL) to SYSTEM when `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is available.

**Requires:**
- `SeImpersonatePrivilege` (standard on service accounts)
- Print Spooler service running (`sc query spooler`)

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| timeout | No | 15 | Seconds to wait for the Print Spooler to connect |

## Usage

### Basic usage (one command)
```
printspoofer
```
Creates a pipe at `\\.\pipe\{random}\pipe\spoolss`, triggers the Print Spooler via `OpenPrinterW`, captures the SYSTEM token.

### With custom timeout
```
printspoofer -timeout 30
```

## How It Works

1. Checks `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is available
2. Creates a named pipe: `\\.\pipe\{suffix}\pipe\spoolss`
3. Calls `OpenPrinterW("\\COMPUTERNAME/pipe/{suffix}")` via `winspool.drv`
4. The Print Spooler (SYSTEM) resolves this to `\\COMPUTERNAME\pipe\{suffix}\pipe\spoolss` and connects
5. `ImpersonateNamedPipeClient` captures the SYSTEM token
6. Token is duplicated and stored in the global identity system

## After Escalation

```
whoami          # Verify SYSTEM context
rev2self        # Revert to original identity when done
```

## Compatibility

{{% notice warning %}}**Patched on Windows 11 23H2+**: Microsoft fixed the Print Spooler path normalization vulnerability. On fully patched Windows 11, OpenPrinterW returns "This computer name is invalid" and the spooler does not connect to the pipe. On older/unpatched Windows (Server 2016, 2019, Windows 10), the technique still works.{{% /notice %}}

For modern Windows, consider alternative SeImpersonate escalation methods:
- **GodPotato/DCOM-based** — uses DCOM activation, not affected by spooler patches
- **pipe-server** — generic pipe impersonation with external trigger

## Comparison with pipe-server

| Feature | printspoofer | pipe-server |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Steps | One command | Requires separate trigger (e.g., coerce) |
| Target | Local Print Spooler | Any connecting client |
| Use case | Quick SYSTEM escalation | General pipe impersonation |
| Patched Win11 | No (technique patched) | Yes (any client can connect) |

Use `printspoofer` for SYSTEM escalation on pre-Win11 23H2 targets. Use `pipe-server` when you need to impersonate a specific remote client connecting to a custom pipe.
