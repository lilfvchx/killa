## Summary

Test credentials (password or NTLM hash) against multiple protocols on target hosts. Validates authentication against SMB, WinRM, and LDAP in parallel.

Completes the lateral movement recon workflow:
1. `lateral-check` â€” identify open services
2. `cred-check` â€” validate credentials against those services
3. `share-hunt` / `psexec` / `winrm` â€” exploit validated access

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| hosts | Yes | - | Target hosts: single IP, comma-separated IPs, or CIDR notation |
| username | Yes | - | Username (DOMAIN\user or user@domain) |
| password | No* | - | Password (*required if hash not provided) |
| hash | No* | - | NTLM hash for pass-the-hash on SMB (hex-encoded) |
| timeout | No | 5 | Per-check timeout in seconds |

## Usage

Test credentials on a single host:
```
cred-check -hosts 192.168.1.100 -username CORP\admin -password Pass123
```

Test across a subnet with pass-the-hash:
```
cred-check -hosts 10.0.0.0/24 -username administrator -hash aad3b435b51404ee:8846f7eaee8fb117
```

## Protocols Tested

| Protocol | Port | Auth Method |
|----------|------|-------------|
| SMB | 445 | NTLM (password or hash) |
| WinRM | 5985 | HTTP Basic Auth |
| LDAP | 389 | Simple Bind |

## Sample Output

```
=== CREDENTIAL CHECK ===
User: CORP\admin

--- 192.168.1.100 ---
  [+] SMB          authenticated (4 shares visible)
  [+] WinRM        authenticated (HTTP 200)
  [+] LDAP         authenticated (LDAP bind success)

--- 192.168.1.101 ---
  [+] SMB          authenticated (2 shares visible)
  [-] WinRM        port 5985 closed/unreachable
  [-] LDAP         auth failed (invalid credentials)

--- 2 host(s) checked, 4 successful auth(s) ---
```
