## Summary

Show currently logged-in users and active sessions. Complementary to `last` (which shows historical login entries) â€” `who` shows only current active sessions.

Useful for understanding who is currently using the system, identifying active administrators, and determining if the system is actively monitored.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| all | No | false | Show all sessions including system accounts and non-user process entries |

## Usage

Show active user sessions:
```
who
```

Show all sessions including system:
```
who -all true
```

## Output Format

Returns a JSON array rendered as a sortable table via browser script:
```json
[
  {
    "user": "admin",
    "tty": "pts/0",
    "login_time": "2025-01-15 09:30:00",
    "from": "192.168.1.100",
    "status": "Active"
  }
]
```

The browser script highlights active sessions in blue and disconnected sessions in orange.
