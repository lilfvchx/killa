## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| path | Yes | Path to file or directory |
| owner | No* | New owner â€” username or numeric UID (*at least one of owner or group required) |
| group | No* | New group â€” group name or numeric GID (*at least one of owner or group required) |
| recursive | No | Apply ownership recursively to directory contents (default: `false`) |

## Usage

### Change owner by username
```
chown -path /tmp/payload -owner root
```

### Change owner and group
```
chown -path /var/data -owner www-data -group www-data
```

### Change by numeric UID/GID
```
chown -path /tmp/file -owner 1000 -group 1000
```

### Recursive directory ownership
```
chown -path /opt/app -owner appuser -group appgroup -recursive true
```

### Change group only
```
chown -path /tmp/shared -group developers
```

## Output

```
[+] /tmp/payload
    Owner: root (uid=0)
```

### With owner and group
```
[+] /var/data
    Owner: www-data (uid=33), www-data (gid=33)
```

### Recursive output
```
[*] 12 items changed to appuser (uid=1001), appgroup (gid=1001)
```

## OPSEC Considerations

- **Requires privileges**: Changing ownership to another user typically requires root. Changing to yourself or your own group is always allowed
- **File metadata changes**: Ownership changes update file metadata (ctime) which may be logged
- **No subprocess**: Uses Go's `os.Chown` â€” no external commands spawned
