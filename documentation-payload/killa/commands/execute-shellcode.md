## Summary

Execute raw shellcode in the current agent process. The shellcode is loaded into a new memory allocation (VirtualAlloc) and executed in a new thread (CreateThread) within the agent process.

Unlike process injection commands (vanilla-injection, apc-injection, etc.), this runs shellcode in the agent's own process without crossing process boundaries. This avoids cross-process injection detection but means the shellcode shares the agent's address space.

## Arguments

Shellcode can be provided via Mythic file upload (UI) or base64-encoded string (API).

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| filename | Yes (Default group) | Select a shellcode file already registered in Mythic |
| file | Yes (New File group) | Upload a new shellcode file |
| shellcode_b64 | Yes (CLI group) | Base64-encoded raw shellcode bytes |

## Usage

```
# From Mythic UI: select a previously uploaded shellcode file from the dropdown
execute-shellcode -filename my_shellcode.bin

# From API: provide base64-encoded shellcode
execute-shellcode -shellcode_b64 "kJBQ..."
```

## OPSEC Considerations

- VirtualAlloc with PAGE_READWRITE followed by VirtualProtect to PAGE_EXECUTE_READ
- CreateThread API call is monitored by many EDR products
- Shellcode runs in the agent process â€” if it crashes, the agent dies
- No cross-process artifacts (no OpenProcess, no WriteProcessMemory)
- Memory allocation and thread creation are in the agent's own process

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- **T1059.006** â€” Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python (shellcode execution)
- **T1055.012** â€” Process Injection: Process Hollowing (memory allocation + execution)
